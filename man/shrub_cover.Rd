\usage{
shrub_cover(path = get_default_data_path(), type = "Shrubs",
  plots = "all", unknowns = FALSE, correct_sp = TRUE,
  download_if_missing = TRUE, quiet = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{either the file path that contains the PortalData folder or
"repo", which then pulls data from the PortalData GitHub repository}

\item{type}{specify subset of species;
If type=Annuals, removes all non-annual species.
If type=Summer Annuals, returns all annual species that can be found in the summer
If type=Winter Annuals, returns all annual species that can be found in the winter
If type=Non-woody, removes shrub and subshrub species
If type=Perennials, returns all perennial species (includes shrubs and subshrubs)
If type=Shrubs, returns only shrubs and subshrubs}

\item{plots}{specify subset of plots; can be a vector of plots, or specific
sets: "all" plots or "Longterm" plots (plots that have had the same
treatment for the entire time series)}

\item{unknowns}{either removes all individuals not identified to species
(unknowns = FALSE) or sums them in an additional column (unknowns = TRUE)}

\item{correct_sp}{correct species names suspected to be incorrect in early data (T/F)}

\item{download_if_missing}{if the specified file path doesn't have the
PortalData folder, then download it}

\item{quiet}{logical, whether to run without version messages}
}
\value{
a data.frame of percent cover and mean height
}
\description{
This function calculates percent cover from transect data.
It handles the pre-2015 data differently from the current transects,
becase they are collected differently. But it returns a single time-series
with all years of transect data available. It also returns mean height
beginning in 2015.
