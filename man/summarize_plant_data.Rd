}
\arguments{
\item{path}{either the file path that contains the PortalData folder or
"repo", which then pulls data from the PortalData GitHub repository}

\item{level}{summarize by "Plot", "Treatment", or "Site"}

\item{type}{specify subset of species;
If type=Annuals, removes all non-annual species.
If type=Summer Annuals, returns all annual species that can be found in the summer
If type=Winter Annuals, returns all annual species that can be found in the winter
If type=Non-woody, removes shrub and subshrub species
If type=Perennials, returns all perennial species (includes shrubs and subshrubs)
If type=Shrubs, returns only shrubs and subshrubs}

\item{length}{specify subset of plots; use "All" plots or only "Longterm"
plots (to be deprecated)}

\item{plots}{specify subset of plots; can be a vector of plots, or specific
sets: "all" plots or "Longterm" plots (plots that have had the same
treatment for the entire time series)}

\item{unknowns}{either removes all individuals not identified to species
(unknowns = FALSE) or sums them in an additional column (unknowns = TRUE)}

\item{correct_sp}{correct species names suspected to be incorrect in early data (T/F)}

\item{shape}{return data as a "crosstab" or "flat" list}

\item{output}{specify whether to return "abundance", or "cover" [cover data
starts in summer 2015]}

\item{na_drop}{logical, drop NA values (representing insufficient sampling)}

\item{zero_drop}{logical, drop 0s (representing sufficient sampling, but no
detections)}

\item{min_quads}{numeric [1:16], minimum number of quadrats (out of 16) for a plot to be included}

\item{effort}{logical as to whether or not the effort columns should be
included in the output}

\item{download_if_missing}{if the specified file path doesn't have the
PortalData folder, then download it}

\item{quiet}{logical, whether to run without version messages}

\item{...}{arguments passed to \code{\link{summarize_plant_data}}}
}
\value{
a data.frame in either "long" or "wide" format, depending on the
  value of `shape`
}
\description{
This function is a generic interface into creating
  summaries of the Portal plant species data. It contains a number of
  arguments to specify both the kind of data to summarize, at what level of
  aggregation, various choices for dealing with data quality, and output
  format.

\code{plant_abundance} generates a table of plant abundance
