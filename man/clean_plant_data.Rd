\usage{
clean_plant_data(data_tables, type = "All", unknowns = FALSE,
  correct_sp = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_tables}{the list of data_tables, returned from calling
\code{\link{load_plant_data}}}

\item{type}{specify subset of species;
If type=Annuals, removes all non-annual species.
If type=Non-woody, removes shrub and subshrub species
If type=Perennials, returns all perennial species (includes shrubs and subshrubs)
If type=Shrubs, returns only shrubs and subshrubs
If type=Winter-annual, returns all annuals found in winter
IF type=Summer-annual, returns all annuals found in summer}

\item{unknowns}{either removes all individuals not identified to species
(unknowns = FALSE) or sums them in an additional column (unknowns = TRUE)}

\description{
This function does basic quality control of the Portal plant
  data. It is mainly called from \code{\link{summarize_plant_data}}, with
  several arguments passed along.

  The specific steps it does are, in order:
    (1) correct species names according to recent vouchers, if requested
    (2) restrict species to annuals or non-woody
    (3) remove records for unidentified species
    (5) exclude the plots that aren't long-term treatments
}
