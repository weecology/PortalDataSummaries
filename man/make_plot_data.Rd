\usage{
make_plot_data(rodent_data, trapping_data, output, min_traps = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{rodent_data}{cleaned rodent data}

\item{trapping_data}{trapping table with treatment column}

\item{output}{specify whether to return "abundance", or "biomass",
or "energy"}

\item{min_traps}{minimum number of traps for a plot to be included}
}
\value{
fully crossed period x plot x species flat table of observations
  with effort (number of traps) and treatment columns. Any plot not
  sufficiently (as defined by min_traps) sampled is returned with NA
  for effort and the output value of interest
