\arguments{
\item{path}{path to location of downloaded Portal data; or "repo" to
retrieve data from github repo}

\item{clean}{passed to load_data (logical, load only QA/QC rodent data (TRUE) or all data (FALSE))}

\item{level}{summarize by "Plot", "Treatment", or "Site"}

\item{type}{specify subset of species; either all "Rodents" or only
"Granivores"}

\item{length}{specify subset of plots; use "All" plots or only "Longterm"
plots (plots that have had same treatment for entire time series)}

\item{unknowns}{either removes all individuals not identified to species
(unknowns = FALSE) or sums them in an additional column (unknowns = TRUE)}

\item{fill_incomplete}{Logical. Either reports raw data from incomplete trapping sessions
(fill_incomplete = FALSE) or estimates corrected values (fill_incomplete = TRUE)
[note that if level="plot" and fill.incomplete=FALSE, NAs will be included in
 periods where trapping was incomplete]}

\item{shape}{return data as a "crosstab" or "flat" list}

\item{time}{specify the format of the time index in the output, either
"period" (sequential Portal surveys), "newmoon" (lunar cycle numbering),
"date" (calendar date)}

\item{output}{specify whether to return "abundance", or "biomass", or
"energy"}

\item{fillweight}{specify whether to fill in unknown weights with other
records from that individual or species, where possible}

\item{na_drop}{logical, drop NA values (representing insufficient sampling)}

\item{zero_drop}{logical, drop 0s (representing sufficient sampling, but no
detections)}

\item{min_traps}{minimum number of traps for a plot to be included}

\item{min_plots}{minimum number of plots within a period for an
observation to be included}

\item{effort}{logical as to whether or not the effort columns should be
included in the output}

\item{...}{arguments passed to \code{\link{get_rodent_data}}}
}
\value{
a data.frame in either "long" or "wide" format, depending on the
  value of `shape`
}
\description{
This function is a generic interface into creating summaries
  of the Portal rodent species data. It contains a number of arguments
  to specify the kind of data to summarize (at what level of aggregation)
  and various choices for dealing with data quality, and output format.

\code{abundance} generates a table of rodent abundance

* \code{biomass()} generates a table of rodent biomass

* \code{energy()} generates a table of rodent energy
  (computed as biomass ^ 0.75)
